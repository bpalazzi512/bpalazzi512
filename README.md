## Hi, I'm Bobby

I'm a rising second-year Honors Computer Science and Mathematics student at Northeastern University with a passion for building. Combined with my love of continuous learning, I've mostly explored Full-Stack Web development in my free time by creating projects that I can use on a day-to-day basis (like a homework tracker!). I'm eager to leverage the experience I've gained into creating unique and innovative solutions alongside expanding my breadth and depth of knowledge. Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate :)
