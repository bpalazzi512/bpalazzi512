## Hi, I'm Bobby

### I'm a rising second-year Honors Computer Science and Mathematics student at Northeastern University with a passion for building. Combined with my love of continuous learning, I've mostly explored Full-Stack Web development in my free time by creating projects that I can use on a day-to-day basis (like a homework tracker!). Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate :)


- I’m currently working on Khoury Odyssey, a Khoury College of Computer Sciences learning platform
- In my free time, I'm working on PicPost, a social media site for sharing whatever, whenever
- I’m currently learning Next.js
